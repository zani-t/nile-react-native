# YourWorld (Nile)
YourWorld is an unfinished app that I developed as a project originally called Nile.
The purpose of this app was to allow users to store news articles to be read in the future. The app was intended to allow for secure login, storage of categories, and a new "article of the day to be displayed each day."
The app employed a React Native frontend with React Native Reanimated animations, as well as a Django and JSON Web Token based backend.
